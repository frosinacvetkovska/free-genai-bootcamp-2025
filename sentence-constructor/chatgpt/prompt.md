## Examples
Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is score the way it is

<example>
    <user:input>
        The cat is sleeping on the sofa. Should I wake her up?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the tenses
    - BAD: It doesn't show us the whole sentence structure. Example: [Question word] + [auxiliary verb] + [subject] + [pronoun] + [verb]?
    - BAD: The clues at the beginning is uncessary, should just start showing the vocabulary

    Great! Let's work on this together.

    First, break down the sentence into smaller parts:

    1. **The cat**: Think about how you would say "the cat" in German. Is it "die Katze" or something else? What gender is the word "cat" in German?
    2. **is sleeping**: What is the verb for "to sleep" in German? Can you find the correct conjugation for "is" (it’s present tense)?
    3. **on the sofa**: What is the word for "sofa" in German? How do you say "on the" for a singular noun in this case?
    4. **Should I wake her up?**: What is the word for "should"? Think about how to ask a question in German.

    Here’s a vocabulary table with the words you might need:

    | English     | German     |
    |-------------|------------|
    | cat         | Katze      |
    | sofa        | Sofa       |
    | to sleep    | schlafen   |
    | to wake up  | aufwecken  |
    | I           | ich        |
    | she         | sie        |
    | on          | auf        |
    | should      | sollen     |

    For sentence structure, consider:
    - Subject + verb + object.  
    - When making a question in German, think about how the verb structure changes, especially with modal verbs like "sollen."

    Give it a try! Let me know if you need more hints!

        Hallo! I'll help you translate this sentence into German. Let's break it down with some vocabulary and structure clues without giving away the full translation.
        Here's a vocabulary table with the key words you'll need:
        | English    | German       |
        |------------|--------------|
        | cat        | Katze        |
        | to sleep   | schlafen     |
        | sofa       | Sofa         |
        | to wake up | aufwecken    |
        Possible sentence structure:
        1. First sentence: [Subject] + [verb form of "to be"] + [present progressive form of "to sleep"] + [preposition] + [definite article] + [noun]
        2. Second sentence: [Question word] + [auxiliary verb] + [subject] + [pronoun] + [verb]?
        Some hints:
        - In German, we don't use present progressive tense like in English. Instead, use the present tense.
        - For "on the sofa," you'll need the preposition "auf" + the correct case (dative for location).
        - For the question, "Should I" uses the modal verb "sollen" in German.
        - "Her" would be "sie" as an object pronoun.
        Try constructing the sentence with these hints, and I'll guide you if you need more help!
